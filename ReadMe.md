### R/qtl2plot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rqtl/qtl2plot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rqtl/qtl2plot)

[Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org)

[R/qtl2](http://kbroman.org/qtl2) (aka qtl2) is a reimplementation of
the QTL analysis software [R/qtl](https://rqtl.org), to better handle
high-dimensional data and complex cross designs. It is split into the
[qtl2geno](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2geno) (for calculating genotype
probabilities, imputations, and genetic maps),
[qtl2scan](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2scan) (for QTL genome scans and
related calculations), and
[qtl2plot](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2plot) (for data visualization).
A further package, [qtl2convert](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2convert),
contains functions for converting data among the R/qtl2,
[DOQTL](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DOQTL.html),
and [R/qtl](https://rqtl.org) formats, for example to convert genotype
probabilities produced by DOQTL to the format needed by qtl2scan, or
to convert qtl2scan results to the format produced by `scanone` in
R/qtl, so that they may be graphed with the R/qtl functions.

### Installation

R/qtl2 is not yet available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), but
it can be installed from a mini-CRAN at [rqtl.org](https://rqtl.org).

    install.packages("qtl2", repos="https://rqtl.org/qtl2cran")

The [qtl2](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2) package is
inspired by the
[tidyverse package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse);
it is basically empty, but when you install it, the
[qtl2geno](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2geno),
[qtl2scan](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2scan),
[qtl2plot](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2plot), and
[qtl2convert](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2convert) packages, plus a
bunch of dependencies, will be installed.

Alternatively, you can install R/qtl2 from its source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rqtl). (But note that compiling the C++
code can be rather slow.)

On _Windows_, you'll need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

On _Mac OS X_, you'll need the
[command-line developer tools](https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/install-command-line-developer-tools-without-xcode-0168115/),
as well as [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS).

You then need to install the
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package, plus a set of
package dependencies: [yaml](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yaml),
[jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite),
[data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table),
and [RcppEigen](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppEigen).
(Additional, secondary dependencies will also be installed.)

    install.packages(c("devtools", "yaml", "jsonlite", "data.table", "RcppEigen"))

Finally, install R/qtl2 using `devtools::install_github()`.

    library(devtools)
    install_github("rqtl/qtl2")
