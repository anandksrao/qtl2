## qtl2 0.7-4 (2017-12-07)

### New features

- The output of `fit1()` now includes fitted values.

- Added function `pull_genoprobpos()` for pulling out a specific
  position (by name or position) from a set of genotype probabilities.

- The `chr` column in the result of `find_peaks()` is now a factor.
  This makes it possible to sort by chromosome. Also added an argument
  `sort_by` for choosing how to sort the rows in the result (by
  column, genomic position, or LOD score).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in `plot.scan1()`, which failed to pass `lodcolumn` to
  `plot_snpasso()`.
